only P1 may use Interfaces.C
only P2 may use Interfaces.C

P4 may use Interfaces.C

-- Note that the same error message will be output twice here, because checks
-- are done once per rule, and there are two lines "only ... may use P3".
-- As this situation (that is to have more than one "only" statement targetting
-- the same unit) is not coherent, I won't change the code and try to fix that.
-- It will remain a "feature".
-- The future syntax "only P1 and P2 may use Interfaces.C" could be a solution.
