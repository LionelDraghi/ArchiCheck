File: TODO list

Rules file:
-       Regroup test on Syntaxic sugar in the rule files, that is to show insensitivity to casing, "," ";" "." Separators, comments, etc.
-       Update the Rules syntax text file to show all syntaxic sugar possibilities (use of "." / ";" / "," / "and", etc.), and to show how to comment
-       Exclude "limited with" from dependencies
-       Implement the _only X can use Y_ rule
-       Implement the _only X can use pragma import_ rule
-       Implement globbing characters, for example _only *.Porting_Kit can use X_
-       Is it useful to have a semantic difference between _only Porting_Kit may depends on C_Files_ and _Porting_Kit is a layer over C_Files_ ?
-       Is it useful to have a _may_ semantics : _GLU may depends on GL_ ?
-       Processing Import pragma as a dependency. e.g. 
        > pragma Import (C, Get_File_Names_Case_Sensitive,
        >                "__gnat_get_file_names_case_sensitive");   

Development environment:
-       Implement a darcs connected version id in the source and helper
-       Update the use of gnat (compiler option, gnatmake replacement))
-       Have the tests OS agnostic (test depending on the path of Ada file analyzed, that fail if run on Windows)
-       Consider replacement of the documentation tools (Dia for UML diagrams, NaturalDocs, etc.)
        for NaturalDocs : https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/, reST/sphinx http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/, http://pandoc.org/index.html
-       Use Livecoding? :-) (https://www.livecoding.tv/livestreams/)

Bug:
-       Implement an error return code when the rules are broken, to allow a normal use in Makefiles, unless -no-error

Features:
-       Change/Simplify the various options to know what the tool understand from the rules file, and from analyzed sources :
-       Implement a command line way to pass simple rules
-       Use <gnu error messages format at https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Errors.html> ( _sourcefile:lineno: message_ ) when identifying a rule that breaks

Documentation:
-       Restructure the home page, to have a short intro and a "quick run" section that summarize "Installing' and "Getting started", and split the rest in other text files.
-       Complete the 2004 slides! :-)
-       Complete the link between NaturalDocs and Tests result, by adding a Result keyword 

Done:
-       Auto add -help output to the doc thanks to Makefile
