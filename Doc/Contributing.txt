About: Installing 

Portability:
Note that the Ada should be pretty platform independant, but I tested it only on my Linux/Intel platform.
Makefile are clearly not portable, and probably need heavy refactoring to run on non Unix like system.

Downloading sources:
If your're an (happy) darcs user :
> darcs clone --lazy https://hub.darcs.net/LioD/ArchiCheck

An Archicheck directory will be created.

Otherwise, <go there at https://hub.darcs.net/LioD/ArchiCheck/dist> to download a zip archive..   

Building:
To build ArchiCheck and the tests, just type 
> make check
in the ArchiCheck root directory.

Needed external software : libopentoken, and gnat gcc Ada compiler. 

On Debian Linux family :
> apt install libopentoken6-dev gnat make 
archicheck exe will be in the Obj directory.

And to build this documentation / web pages:
> make doc
Needed external software : ploticus, NaturalDocs, sloccount and lcov. 
On Debian Linux family :
> apt install ploticus naturaldocs sloccount lcov

About: To contribute
The easiest way to contribute (at this stage) is to use darcs, and to submit darcs patches, whatever is changed or added in the code, tests, text file, etc.
Anyway, ideas or feedback are welcome <here at lionel.draghi@free.fr>.

The shortest tuto: 
> darcs clone --lazy https://hub.darcs.net/LioD/ArchiCheck  # should be already done
*then hack the code, tests and doc!*
> darcs record -a -m "what my patch does"
> darcs send -o patch_file
send the generated patch_file <to ArchiCheck maintainer at lionel.draghi@free.fr>
