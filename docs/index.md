Quick overview
-------------------

Simple structural aspect of the software architecture, metaphore like _My software is a layered system_, can not be fully translated at languages level. Even in languages like Ada, powerfull regarding description of the software structure, there is a semantic loss.

![The code doesn't tell the whole story!](semantic_gap.png)

Sooner or later, in large or complex developpement, someone will propose a patch adding an `Ã¬mport` that compile fine, but is a complete violation of the architecture.

Archicheck is a simple [free software](copying.md) tool that :  
1. ease architecture description, with a simple language. 
   > It's really as simple as: _Gtk is a layer over Gdk_.  
2. enforce code compliance with that description.

Run it!

Archicheck needs :

- a bunch of sources : give the directories with one or more `-I` options;
- an architecture description, called a [`rules file`](rules.md) : a simple text file describing your architecture.

Let's consider the following file `My_Architecture.ac`, that describes a simple layered architecture :

```
Presentation_Layer contains pkg_1, pkg_2
Application_Layer  contains pkg_3, pkg_4

Presentation_Layer is a layer over Application_Layer
```

Run ArchiCheck that way:  
> _archicheck -I src My_Architecture.txt_  

([`archicheck -h` for a complete list of options](cmd_line.md))

It will check that the code comply with your architecture.

For example, here, it will check that pkg_3 or pkg_4 (in the lower layer) are not using pkg_1 or pkg_2 (in the upper layer).
